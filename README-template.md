### What I learned

1. **Using the "span" Element to Display Star Ratings:**
```html
    <span class="stars">★★★★★</span>
```
	  Here I learned:

- `span` : to display star ratings, allowing for easy styling and inline display within the content.


2. **Ensuring Consistent Styling Across Different Browsers:**
 ```css
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
	  Here I learned:
- universal selector `*`: to enforce consistent styling across all elements. ensuring a consistent starting point across different browsers
- `padding: 0;`: eliminate unexpected spacing within elements
- `box-sizing: border-box;`: to simplify element size calculations by including padding and borders in the total width and height


3. **Overlaying Profile Images with Absolute Positioning:**
 ```css
profile-pic {
    border: 5px solid #fff;
    border-radius: 50%;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    position: absolute;
    top: 24%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
}
```
	 Here I learned:
- `position: absolute` and `transform: translateX(-50%);` to center profile images over other content


4. **Adjusting Letter Spacing for Star Ratings::**
 ```css
.stars {
  ...
  letter-spacing: 0.1em;
}
```
	 Here I learned:
- `letter-spacing`: to add spacing between the star characters, improving readability


5. **Removing Default Margins:**
 ```css
.star-rating p {
   ...
   margin: 0;
}
```
	 Here I learned:
- `margin: 0;`: on paragraph elements to remove default margins, ensuring precise text alignment within the container


6. **Using Flexbox for a Flexible and Responsive Design:**
 ```css
.star-rating p {
    ...
    flex: 1;
}
```
	 Here I learned:
- `flex: 1;`: applied to paragraphs to allow them to occupy available space in the flex container, ensuring a responsive design


7. **Aligning Items to the Start Using Flexbox Properties:**
 ```css
.star-rating-item {
    ...
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: flex-start;
    ...
}
```
	 Here I learned:
- using `display: flex;` with `align-items: center;` `justify-content: flex-start;`: to align content items to the start
